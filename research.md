Through my work, I have taken a keen interest in understanding the interactions of humans and machine learning models. 
As Machine Learning models become ubiquitous, it's incredibly important for us to gain a better understanding of these interactions, and the influence they have on our decision-making.
This includes human-in-the-loop ML, interpretability and explainability of ML models, their effect on human decision-making and the subjectivity that's present while annotating data and evaluations.

My early research focused on computer vision and multimodal learning.
