<p>Hi! Pleased to meet you :)</p>

I am currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science with specialization in Machine Learning at Columbia University, New York.

<p>Previously, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati with a bachelors in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Product Design. Before joining Columbia University, I worked as a Software Engineer in the Data Platform team at PayPal for a year.</p>

<p>I am interested in working in the field of Machine Learning. The intuitiveness of ML and the human learning process fascinates me. Recently, the work done as a part of my Bachelors' Thesis Project got <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7872382/">published</a> in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.</p>

<p>You can visit the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">Projects</a> tab for more details about my work.</p>

<p> My resume can be found <a href="{% if site.resume-external %}{{ site.resume-url }}{% else %}{{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}{% endif %}">here</a>.</p>
