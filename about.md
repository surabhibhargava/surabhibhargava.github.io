<p>Hi! Pleased to meet you :)</p>

<p>I am a software engineer in the Data Platform Engineering team at PayPal. Previously, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati with a bachelors in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Product Design.</p>
<p>In August 2017, I will be joining Columbia University, New York to pursue my Masters in Computer Science. </p>
<p>I am interested in working in the field of Machine Learning. The intuitiveness of ML and the human learning process fascinates me. Recently, the work done as a part of my Bachelors' Thesis Project got <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7872382/">published</a> in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.</p>

<p>You can visit the <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">Projects</a> tab for more details about my work.</p>

<p> My resume can be found <a href="{% if site.resume-external %}{{ site.resume-url }}{% else %}{{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}{% endif %}">here</a>.</p>
