description: Generalized Nuclear Segmentation in Computational Pathology
---

<p>As a part of our Bachelors' thesis project, <a href="https://sanuj.github.io/">Sanuj</a> and I worked on developing a deep learning based technique to segment out nuclei in histopathological images. As a part of this project, we have also released an open source dataset of H&E stained tissue images with more than 21,000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries.</p>

<p>This work has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.</p>
