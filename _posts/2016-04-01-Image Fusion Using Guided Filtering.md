description: Image Fusion using Guided Filtering
---

<p>This project was done as a part of my Computer Vision Course Project.</p>

<p>The algorithm is an implementation of the paper: Li, Shutao, Xudong Kang, and Jianwen Hu. "Image fusion with guided filtering." Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on 22.7 (2013): 2864-2875.</p>

A few results of the image fusion are as follows. Here, the first two images are fused to form the third image.

Image 1 | Image 2 | Fused Image
-|-|-
![Image 1](/assets/a09_1.png) | ![Image 2](/assets/a09_2.png) | ![Fused Image](/assets/a09_fused.png)

Image 1 | Image 2 | Fused Image
-|-|-
![Image 1](/assets/b01_1.png) | ![Image 2](/assets/b01_2.png) | ![Fused Image](/assets/b01_fused.png)

Image 1 | Image 2 | Fused Image
-|-|-
![Image 1](/assets/c01_1.png) | ![Image 2](/assets/c01_2.png) | ![Fused Image](/assets/c01_fused.png)
