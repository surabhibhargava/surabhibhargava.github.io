description: Timing model for two stage buffer & its applications in ECSM characterization
---

After completion of my sophomore year at college, I interned at IIT Roorkee from May 2014-July 2014, under Prof. Anand Bulusu.

As a part of this internship, I derived an analytical Threshold Crossing Point (TCP) model for a two stage buffer which relates TCPs (Threshold Crossing Point) with the input transition time and load capacitance. This work has been published in the 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test, 2015. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7208075/">Click here for Paper</a>

The ECSM characterization using the proposed model results in a 50% reduction of HSPICE simulations and and gives values differing by a maximum of 2% from the actual values (HSPICE simulated).
